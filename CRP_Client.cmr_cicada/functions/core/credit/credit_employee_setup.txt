CICADA CREDIT COMPANY EMPLOYEE SYSTEM - SETUP GUIDE
====================================================

1. ADD EMPLOYEE WHITELIST:
   Edit: CRP_Server\functions\credit\credit_employeeWhitelist.fnc
   Add player UIDs to the credit_employeeWhitelist array:
   
   credit_employeeWhitelist = [
       "76561198123456789",  // Player 1 UID
       "76561198987654321"   // Player 2 UID
   ];

2. ADD DIALOG TO description.ext:
   In your description.ext file, add:
   #include "data\dialogs\credit_employee_dialog.hpp"

3. ADD EMPLOYEE ACTION TO BUILDING:
   In your mission file or init script, add an action to your Cicada Credit Company building:
   
   cicada_building addaction [
       "Employee Portal",
       "noscript.sqf",
       "call credit_employee_open;",
       25,
       false,
       true,
       "LeanRight",
       "player distance _target < 5"
   ];
   
   Replace "cicada_building" with your actual building object variable name.

4. HOW IT WORKS:
   - Players with credit score < 500 automatically have applications sent for review
   - Employees see pending applications in the Employee Portal
   - Employees can approve or reject applications
   - Approved applications bypass credit score requirements
   - All employees are notified when new applications arrive

5. ADMIN COMMANDS (Server Console):
   To add an employee:
   [player, targetPlayer] call S_credit_addEmployee;
   
   To remove an employee:
   [player, targetPlayer] call S_credit_removeEmployee;
