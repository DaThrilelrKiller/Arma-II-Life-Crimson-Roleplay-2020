CREDIT CARD SHOP INTEGRATION GUIDE
===================================

To integrate credit card into your shop payment system, you need to update the shops_ProcessMoney function.

FIND: CRP_Client.cmr_cicada\functions\core\shops\shops_ProcessMoney.fnc

UPDATE THE FUNCTION TO INCLUDE CREDIT CARD SUPPORT:

1. Add credit card check after debit card check:
   _hasCreditCard = ([player,"Credit_Card"] call storage_amount > 0) && credit_hasCard;
   _creditAvailable = if (_hasCreditCard) then {credit_cardLimit - credit_cardBalance} else {0};

2. Update total calculation:
   _total = if (_hasDebitCard) then {_wallet + _bank} else {_wallet};
   _total = _total + _creditAvailable; // Add credit card available credit

3. Add credit card payment option in the payment processing section:
   // After checking bank account, add:
   else {
       if (_hasCreditCard && _creditAvailable >= _cost) then {
           if ([_cost] call credit_processPayment) then {
               systemChat format ["Paid %1 using credit card", [_cost] call Main_FormatMoney];
               _return = true;
           };
       };
   };

ALTERNATIVE: Use the integrated credit_ProcessMoney function I created which handles all payment methods automatically.

Replace calls to shops_ProcessMoney with credit_ProcessMoney for automatic credit card support.
